# HTSeq
HTSeq is a Python library to facilitate processing and analysis of data from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) experiments. 

**NOTE**: htseq is currently undergoing a major update. The `master` (python2.7) and `python3` (python>=3.4) branches on github require `pysam>=0.9`, but the PyPI version refers to the last stable release, which is only compatible with `pysam<=0.8.0`.We will update the PyPI version within the next few weeks (hopefully!).

### pypi_CI branch
This branch is used to test installation from PyPI and contains only tests and no actual code.
