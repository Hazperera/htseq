[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simon-anders/htseq.svg?branch=python3)](https://travis-ci.org/simon-anders/htseq)

HTSeq is a Python library to facilitate processing and analysis of data from 
high-throughput sequencing (HTS) experiments. 

If you read this text on github: This page is meant for HTSeq 
developers. If you want to use HTSeq or are looking for
documentation, please see:

**NOTE**: htseq is currently undergoing a major update. The `master` (python2.7) and `python3` (python>=3.4) branches on github require `pysam>=0.9`, but the PyPI version refers to the last stable release, which is only compatible with `pysam<=0.8.0`.We will update the PyPI version within the next few weeks (hopefully!).
